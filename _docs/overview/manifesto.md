Our Design is as unique as our business
We create layered and scalable UX paradigms designed to capture business value. 
Unlike our competitors, We won’t mandate the use of the generic UX for all situations, but focus on creating ideal designs for specific business use cases. 
Visibility and control of our users’ journeys.
Coople Design System will provide business, design, and IT teams with clear insight into an userʼs journey at all stages.

Consistency is not as Feature it’s a standard 
Coople DS is built from reusable UX patterns that helps us create system builds a consistent mental model for users, helping them to move through navigation and interaction effortlessly.

Massive Scalibility
Create multiple application views for various roles, devices, or other contexts. A Coopler view, an employee view, and mobile app view all work from a single model and set of business logic.

Cross Channeling 
Research shows 90% of customers use multiple devices to accomplish a single task. A user can initiate an interaction on a website (app) and finish with a phone call seamlessly. Coople UX should maintain user state, even when users switch Devices.

Low-code Revolution
Coople DS will help our teams to create future-proof front-end code. Code is kept up-to-date - even as new technologies emerge - freeing you to focus on user experience.

Layered and inheritable UI architecture.
Frequently used UI elements and interactions — such as a change-of-address form — can be repeated across all of your enterprise applications. Each adjustment cascades through all applications or specific ones. The power to scale is as simple as the click of a button.
