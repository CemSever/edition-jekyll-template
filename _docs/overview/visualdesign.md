Secondary font that we use is « Open Sans » because of it’s performance in micro typographie. These two families is suffisent for Coople brand however few additional typefaces are used in our digital products due to their appropriateness for digital, for various reasons including their suitability to the content, platform (e.g. iOS, Android), localization, greater legibility or faster loading time.
