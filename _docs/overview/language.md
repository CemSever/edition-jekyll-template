Consistency, communication and transparency between teams that work on our digital products is hard. There is clearly a need to connect with and build bridges between these teams, our designers, engineers and product managers. Coople Design Systems aims to establish our digital guidelines and standards, then raise awareness and adoption of those guidelines across teams — working towards building world class, consistent digital products and experiences.
