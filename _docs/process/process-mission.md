UX MISSION

- Create a sustainable and scalable UX design methodology.
- Drive the development of outstanding front-end code.
- Design, validate, iterate and refine in a cyclical fashion to ensure continued improvement.
- Craft a pattern library to improve efficiency, accuracy, and usability.


UX PROCESS

DESIGN - Every product and feature must start with design.
VALIDATION - Validate the design before development.
AGILE - Keep it agile — collaborate, adapt, and iterate.

1. Define business goals
Explore, determine and document the business goals of the product or feature, focusing on highest value outcomes, while keeping an open mind about how to achieve the goal.
2. Conduct research
Discover the requirements necessary to achieve the established goals, complete a competitive analysis, review feasibility, and define scope of the design work.
3. Explore concept design
Consider relevant existing paradigms as well as alternative design approaches. Seek feedback from UX design colleagues and other key stakeholders. Build a vision of the product or feature including sketches, wireframes and prototypes to validate in usability testing.
4. Document design plan
Create the necessary documentation and assets including validated and refined screens, POCs, videos of interaction design and any other relevant design files.
5. Build
Implement and monitor the design plan, modifying as needed to accommodate feasibility issues that arise during the course of development.
6. Release product or feature
Monitor post-release success, focusing on where to improve usability and value to the market for the next release.
